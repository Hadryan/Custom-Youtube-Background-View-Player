# Custom-Youtube-Background-View-Player
Built this using the YouTube Player Javascript API. Wanted to be able to overlay music related content like lyrics, track info etc. on top of music-visuals to create an interactive player. Spent some time adding nice transitions (synchronous fade-out of the youtube-player and audio for example) and controls to navigate a youtube playlist.
